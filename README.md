[Machine Learning for Finance, Algorithmic Trading and Investing Slides](https://github.com/anthonyng2/Machine-Learning-For-Finance/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20-%20Linear%20Regression%20for%20Algo%20Trading%20v2017-07-13.pdf)

These set of slides explained the current asset management environment and the advanced of technology on asset management. Categories of Machine and Deep Learning are explained. A brief introduction on linear regression and associated assumptions are covered. Stylized statistical properties of financial time series and asset returns are presented highlighting the challenges. 

To ease learners to understand machine learning, linear regression has been used as the conduit. Firstly, the shortcoming of linear regression is highlighted. We then follow by the steps of model building and covering concepts such as hyperparameters, cross-validation, model validation, bias-variance tradeoff. The 6 stages of professional quant strategy is also covered to provide some perspective on where machine learning fits in.

This backtest utilise Python statsmodel to build the linear regression model. We then move on to illustrate how one can use the Python scikit-learn model to do likewise.
